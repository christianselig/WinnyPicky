# WinnyPicky

Small iPhone app that powered the Apollo 2020 iPhone 12 giveaway

# How to Use

If you have the most recent version of Xcode installed, simply create a new project (File > New Project) and in the created `ViewController.swift`, swap out the contents with the contents of `ViewController.swift` in this repo. Then just run the project either on a simulator or on an iOS device and you're good to go!

# Notes

- Thanks to the [PushShift](https://pushshift.io) API for powering the app, makes it easy to query Reddit at large for research purposes.
- Thanks to [u/The_White_Light](https://old.reddit.com/user/The_White_Light) on Reddit for suggesting PushShift for this as well as a cool Python script, as well as [@Smith_Jansen](https://twitter.com/Smith_Jansen2) on Twitter for showing me a [very cool Python library](https://github.com/lilfruini/CommentGathering-MillionaireMakers) for doing a similar thing and offering some pointers.
